Player 1 is on the left of Player 0, Player 2 is on the left of Player 1, etc. Since the game proceeds in counter-clockwise direction, if player 0 just played a card, then it will be player 1's turn to play a card, unless player 1 started the round.

                    You should then tell the judge which THREE cards you would like to pass, one on each line. If some of your choices are INVALID (e.g. you do not own that card, invalid format, etc), then the judge will replace that response with a randomly picked (but valid) card from your hand. You algorithm should be fast. <strong>The timeout for this part is 30 seconds.</strong> If you go over that time limit, the judge will take over and pick for you. <strong>In the case of <code>NP</code>, your code should still output three lines of something.</strong> It doesn't matter what something is, because their values are completely ignored by the judge. This is done so that simplier agents that do not implement card-passing can simpliy output three junk values here, without having to distingush between the various case of passing or non-passing rounds.
